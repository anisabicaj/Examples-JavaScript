//1 Request a user’s name and display the response “Hello, [name]”.
//2 Request a user’s year of birth, count his age, and display the result. Store the current year as a constant.
//3 Request a length of a side of a square from a user and display the perimeter of the square.
//4 Request a radius of a circle and display the area of such a circle.
//5 Request a distance in km between the two cities from a user, and the time they want to cover it within. Count the speed needed to be on time.
//6 Create a currency converter. A user types in USD and the program converts them to EUR. The exchange rate should be stored as a constant.
//7 A user states a flash drive memory in GB. The program has to count how many 820MB files can be stored on this flash drive.
//8 A user types in an amount of money in a wallet and the price of one chocolate bar. The program counts how many chocolate bars the user can buy, and how much change will he/she have left.
//9 The user types in a sum of bank deposits for 2 months with a yearly interest rate of 5%. The program counts the sum of interest.
